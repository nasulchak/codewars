// ‚ùì DESCRIPTION:
// The look and say sequence is a sequence in which each number is the result of a "look and say" operation on the previous element.
// Considering for example the classical version startin with "1": ["1", "11", "21, "1211", "111221", ...]. You can see that the second element describes the first as "1(times number)1", the third is "2(times number)1" describing the second, the fourth is "1(times number)2(and)1(times number)1" and so on.
// Your goal is to create a function which takes a starting string (not necessarily the classical "1", much less a single character start) and return the nth element of the series.
// Examples
// lookAndSaySequence("1", 1)   === "1"
// lookAndSaySequence("1", 3)   === "21"
// lookAndSaySequence("1", 5)   === "111221"
// lookAndSaySequence("22", 10) === "22"
// lookAndSaySequence("14", 2)  === "1114"
// Trivia: "22" is the only element that can keep the series constant.

// ‚úÖ SOLUTION:
function lookAndSayStep(str) {
    let result = '';
    let count = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
        if (str[i] === str[i + 1]) {
            count++;
        } else {
            result += count + str[i];
            count = 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

function lookAndSaySequence(start, n) {
    let current = start;

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        current = lookAndSayStep(current);
    }

    return current;
}

// üèÅ Example usage:
console.log(lookAndSaySequence("1", 1));   // "1"
console.log(lookAndSaySequence("1", 3));   // "21"
console.log(lookAndSaySequence("1", 5));   // "111221"
console.log(lookAndSaySequence("22", 10)); // "22"
console.log(lookAndSaySequence("14", 2));  // "1114"
